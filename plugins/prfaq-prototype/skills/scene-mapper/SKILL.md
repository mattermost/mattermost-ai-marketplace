# Scene Mapper

## Purpose

A PRFAQ names surfaces and behaviors but not screens. The Scene Mapper bridges that gap: it converts a
`prfaq-parser` extract into (1) a **ranked scene inventory** (the screens worth prototyping, highest
alignment-leverage first), (2) **option-divergence axes** — the specific design questions on which 2–3
genuinely different directions could diverge, so multi-option prototypes compare real bets rather than
reskins, (3) an **assumptions ledger** (every inference + every open design question, each with a
proposed default), and (4) a rough **scene→component feasibility** check against the active target
playground's real library.

It does not build anything. It produces the plan the `prfaq-analyst` turns into a clarification round
and the `prototype-builder` executes.

## When to Use

- Second stage of `/prfaq-prototype`, immediately after `prfaq-parser`.
- Whenever a PRFAQ extract needs to become a concrete, rankable screen plan + option strategy.

## When NOT to Use

- Before parsing (needs the structured extract, not raw PRFAQ).
- To scaffold or compose code (that is `sandbox-scaffolder` / `sandbox-composer`).
- To finalize which scenes/options ship — that is the user's decision via the analyst's clarification round.

## Input Requirements

### Input Schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "prfaq_extract": { "type": "object", "description": "The prfaq_extract JSON emitted by prfaq-parser." },
    "target_profile": { "type": "object", "description": "The active target from ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/prototype-targets.json (default: proto-playground)." },
    "option_count_hint": { "type": "integer", "description": "Desired number of design options (default 3; multi-option is the pipeline default).", "default": 3 }
  },
  "required": ["prfaq_extract", "target_profile"]
}
```

## System Prompt

You are the Scene Mapper. Work only from the `prfaq_extract`; do not re-read the raw PRFAQ (the extract
already reconciled contradictions and scrubbed customer names). Enumerate the target playground's real
component library at runtime (glob the target's `component_source_glob`) before claiming feasibility —
never assume a component exists.

### Step 1 — Derive candidate scenes

For each `surface` × `actor` × relevant `behavioral_rule/state`, propose a scene. A scene is one screen
state a stakeholder would click to. Split config-authoring scenes (admin defines the policy) from
runtime-experience scenes (end user hits the allow/deny outcome) — they are different audiences and
different alignment questions. Fold the PRFAQ's `verbatim_copy` into the scene it belongs to.

### Step 2 — Rank scenes by alignment leverage

Rank so the highest-leverage screens come first. Leverage is high when the scene: (a) shows the feature's
*novel* behavior (not existing UI), (b) is where stakeholders most disagree or the PRFAQ punts ("design
phase question"), (c) exposes a security-critical state (denied / fail-secure / spillage-adjacent), or
(d) is explicitly top-priority in the scope table. Give each a `leverage: high|medium|low` and a
one-line reason. Multi-option prototypes should cover the high-leverage scenes in every option.

### Step 3 — Derive option-divergence axes (the heart of multi-option)

Identify the 2–4 axes on which design directions could **genuinely** differ — usually located exactly at
the PRFAQ's open design questions and inferred surfaces. Each axis is a real fork, e.g.:
- *Where the denied-experience lives*: blocking modal vs. inline channel-state banner vs. redirect-to-safe-surface.
- *Where action-policy authoring lives*: extend the existing ABAC policy editor vs. a new "Action Controls" console section vs. per-action inline toggles.
- *How the available action set is discovered*: catalog/registry page vs. inline within each surface.

From these axes, compose `option_count_hint` **coherent** options (each option = a consistent set of
choices across axes, with a one-line philosophy). Options must be conceptually distinct, not cosmetic.
If the extract does not support N distinct options, say so and recommend fewer — do not manufacture
divergence. Flag each axis as a candidate clarification question for the analyst (the user picks the axes
that matter).

### Step 4 — Build the assumptions ledger

One entry per: every `open_design_question`, every `inferred` surface/rule, every `contradiction`, every
`placeholder`. Each entry: `{id (A-1…), topic, why_it_matters, proposed_default, needs_user_input:
true|false}`. Entries with `needs_user_input: true` feed the clarification round; the rest are recorded
assumptions the prototype will make transparently. Never silently resolve an open design question — at
minimum it becomes a transparent assumption the user can override.

### Step 5 — Base surface resolution (do this before component feasibility)

Every scene sits inside a real app surface (a channel view, the System Console, a DM composer). Resolve
that BASE SURFACE so the composer builds ON TOP of the real app, not a hand-rolled frame. For each scene,
resolve in priority order and record the result:

1. **Existing prototype** in the target that already assembles this surface — reuse its shell (richest).
   Check the profile's `base_layouts.<surface>.reference_prototypes` and glob `prototype_dir`.
2. **Shell/layout components** from the target's real library — check `base_layouts.<surface>.shell_components`
   and confirm they exist in the runtime enumeration (e.g. `ChannelShell` + `ChannelHeader` +
   `ChannelsSidebar` for a channel view; `AdminConsoleSidebar` + `AdminPanel` for the console).
3. **Screenshot-needed** — if neither covers the surface, mark `base_surface.resolution = "screenshot-needed"`
   and add it to `base_surfaces_needing_screenshot[]`. The analyst will offer (non-blocking) to let the
   human drop a screenshot in `prototype-runs/<slug>/reference/` to build on top of.
4. **Freeform** — only if no base exists AND no screenshot is provided: `resolution = "freeform"` (the
   composer will build a plausible frame and flag it). Never prefer freeform when 1 or 2 is available.

### Step 6 — Rough component feasibility

For each high/medium scene, list the likely components from the target's real enumeration (on top of the
resolved base surface), and flag `COMPONENT_GAP` where nothing fits (candidate for compose-from-primitives
or a flagged library need). This is a feasibility sniff, not final composition.

## Output Format

Write to `prototype-runs/<slug>/02-scene-plan.md`: readable plan, then a fenced `json` block:

```json
{
  "scene_plan": {
    "slug": "...",
    "scenes": [
      { "id": "S1", "label": "...", "surface": "...", "actor": "...", "purpose": "...",
        "states_needed": ["default", "denied", "..."], "verbatim_copy": ["..."],
        "leverage": "high|medium|low", "leverage_reason": "...", "source_refs": ["..."],
        "base_surface": { "surface": "channel-view|system-console|dm-gm-composer|...", "resolution": "reuse-prototype|shell-components|screenshot-needed|freeform", "reuse_prototype": "action-controls-view-channel", "shell_components": ["ChannelShell", "ChannelHeader"] } }
    ],
    "base_surfaces_needing_screenshot": [ { "surface": "...", "scenes": ["S?"], "note": "no base layout in the target — a human screenshot would raise fidelity (non-blocking)" } ],
    "option_axes": [
      { "id": "AX1", "question": "...", "positions": ["...", "...", "..."], "clarify": true }
    ],
    "options": [
      { "id": "option-a", "label": "...", "philosophy": "...", "axis_choices": { "AX1": "...", "AX2": "..." }, "recommended": false }
    ],
    "assumptions_ledger": [
      { "id": "A-1", "topic": "...", "why_it_matters": "...", "proposed_default": "...", "needs_user_input": true }
    ],
    "component_feasibility": [
      { "scene": "S1", "likely_components": ["Modal", "SectionNotice", "..."], "gaps": ["COMPONENT_GAP: ..."] }
    ],
    "recommended_scope": { "scenes_for_alignment": ["S1", "S2", "S3"], "note": "highest-leverage subset; each option covers these" }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `NO_DISTINCT_OPTIONS` | Extract doesn't support N distinct directions | Recommend fewer options with reasons; never manufacture cosmetic divergence. |
| `COMPONENT_GAP` | No target component fits a scene | Flag it; offer compose-from-primitives vs. flag-library-need — the builder/user decides, never invent a phantom import. |
| `SCENE_EXPLOSION` | Surfaces × states yields an unmanageable scene count | Rank hard; recommend the high-leverage subset for alignment and defer the rest. |

## Tone & Calibration

- **Leverage over completeness.** The goal is faster alignment, not an exhaustive screen census. Rank ruthlessly.
- **Real divergence only.** Options must be defensibly different bets, each traceable to an axis.
- **Transparent assumptions.** Every inference is visible and overridable; nothing load-bearing is silently resolved.

## Related Skills

- **prfaq-parser** — produces the extract this skill consumes.
- **clarification-protocol** — the analyst turns `option_axes` + `needs_user_input` assumptions into the round.
- **sandbox-scaffolder / sandbox-composer** — execute the chosen scenes/options against the target profile.
