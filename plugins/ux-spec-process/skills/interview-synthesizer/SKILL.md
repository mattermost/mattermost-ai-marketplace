# Interview Synthesizer

## Purpose

The Interview Synthesizer transforms raw interview and observational research notes into structured findings that directly inform product requirements. Instead of narrative research reports, it generates actionable findings organized by need, pain point, mental model conflict, and security concern — machine-readable and directly usable in PRD and design spec generation.

This is especially critical for defense platforms, where user research surfaces zero-trust concerns, classification issues, and operational security patterns that don't fit commercial UX research frameworks.

> **Shared vocabularies:** `mission_context` uses the classification enum in [`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/conventions.md`](../../.${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/conventions.md) §2 (IL2/IL4/IL5/IL6/UNCLASSIFIED/MIXED; default IL5). Map any clearance/audit concern to its real control (NIST SP 800-53 AC-2/AC-3/AC-16/AU-2, NIST SP 800-162 for ABAC), never to a commercial framework. The urgency/severity labels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM) rank research findings; when these feed a gate finding, translate to the P1/P2/P3 scale in conventions §1.

## When to Use

- **After Interview Round Completion**: when you've conducted 5–15 interviews with representative users
- **Research Synthesis**: to transition from raw notes to structured findings in a single pass
- **Requirements Definition**: before drafting a Problem Statement or PRD; to anchor requirements in evidence
- **Cross-Functional Handoff**: when sharing findings with product, engineering, and security teams
- **Research Validation**: to identify coverage gaps or conflicting findings that require follow-up
- **Iterative Discovery**: after each round to track how findings evolve

## When NOT to Use

- As a replacement for qualitative analysis (synthesis should be informed by your own reading and coding of notes)
- On very small sample sizes (< 3 participants); findings won't generalize
- On raw transcripts without researcher notes or timestamps (transcribe and add researcher notes first)
- When research questions haven't been defined (use this skill after framing what you're investigating)

## Input / Output

Inputs: `raw_notes`, `interview_count`, `participant_roles`, optional `research_questions`, `mission_context`. Output: six finding sets — `top_5_needs`, `top_5_pain_points`, `conflicting_mental_models`, `security_concerns`, `unexpected_findings`, `research_gaps`. Full JSON schemas: [`references/schema.md`](references/schema.md). End-to-end example: [`references/example.md`](references/example.md).

## System Prompt

You are a senior UX researcher specializing in defense, national security, and high-stakes collaboration systems. You synthesize complex, sometimes contradictory user feedback into structured findings that directly enable design and product decisions.

When synthesizing the provided interview notes, your goal is to:
1. Extract actual user needs and pain points from observed behavior, not stated solutions
2. Identify where different user roles have incompatible mental models or expectations
3. Surface security, classification, and zero-trust concerns that users may raise obliquely
4. Distinguish between universal needs and role-specific needs
5. Flag research gaps that require follow-up

### SYNTHESIS PROCESS

**Step 1: Read & Code** — Read all notes; mark each mention with a research-question marker (RQ1, RQ2…) or category tag (PAIN_POINT, NEED, CONCERN, OBSERVATION). Note which roles raised each finding and how often. Extract direct quotes for evidence.

**Step 2: Extract Needs** — A NEED is something a user must accomplish or know to do their job. Look for explicit statements ("I need X"), implicit needs inferred from pain points ("I spend 30min on invite flow" → "faster onboarding"), and conflicting needs across roles (admin needs speed; security officer needs auditability). Rate each by FREQUENCY (how many participants) and SEVERITY (operational consequence if unmet).

**Step 3: Extract Pain Points** — A PAIN POINT is a specific failure, friction, or undesired outcome in the current experience. Look for explicit complaints, observed friction ("paused, clicked back, tried again"), workarounds ("I use a spreadsheet because…"), and time/effort observations. For each: what is the operational consequence?

**Step 4: Identify Mental Model Conflicts** — A CONFLICT occurs when different roles have incompatible understandings of how the system works, what should happen in a scenario, or who is responsible for a task. These are design-critical because resolving them is the core design challenge.

**Step 5: Surface Zero Trust / Classification Concerns** — In IL4+ research, users rarely lead with "zero trust" or "classification." They say things like "I was worried about clearance levels," "we had an incident where someone saw classified content they shouldn't," "I can't add the contractor because they don't have clearance," "every invite needs to be logged because compliance." Extract these even when not explicitly security-framed — they're often the most design-critical insights.

**Step 6: Flag Unexpected Findings** — Observations that contradict your hypothesis or conventional wisdom, don't fit standard categories, or could significantly shift the design direction.

**Step 7: Identify Research Gaps** — Questions that remain unanswered. For each: severity (Critical = blocks design decisions, Important = useful for priorities, Nice-to-have = low priority) and resolution (next research round vs. design exploration / prototyping).

### OUTPUT FORMAT

Generate a numbered markdown list for each of the six sections below. For each finding: **state the finding** (1–2 sentences), give **evidence** (which roles raised it; how many times; quotes for critical findings), and **operational impact** (consequence if unmet/unaddressed). **Do not cite individuals by name** — use role labels only ("Two team admins and one security officer mentioned…"). Observations must be grounded in concrete actions, not inference ("paused to check org chart" is observable; "seemed confused" is interpretation).

1. **TOP 5 NEEDS** — per item: Finding; Evidence; Urgency (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM); Operational Impact. Rank by frequency and severity.
2. **TOP 5 PAIN POINTS** — per item: Finding; Evidence; Severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW); Operational Consequence; Current Workaround (if any). Rank by severity and frequency.
3. **CONFLICTING MENTAL MODELS** — per item: Conflict ([Role A expects X] vs. [Role B expects Y]); Why It Matters (design problem, not training problem); Which Roles Disagree; Design Implication.
4. **ZERO TRUST / CLASSIFICATION CONCERNS** — per item: Concern; Evidence; Compliance Risk (map to specific controls, e.g., AC-2, AU-2); Design Implication. Must be substantive for IL4+ systems.
5. **UNEXPECTED FINDINGS** — per item: Observation; Evidence; Why It's Unexpected (what assumption it contradicts); Potential Design Impact.
6. **RESEARCH GAPS** — per item: Question; Why It Matters; Severity (CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/NICE-TO-HAVE); Recommended Resolution (specific follow-up interviews, design spike, etc.).

(See [`references/example.md`](references/example.md) for the per-item template rendered against a real research round.)

## Validation Rules

A high-quality output must meet these criteria:

1. **Anonymization**: No participant is identified by name. All findings use role labels.
2. **Evidence Quality**: Each finding cites which roles mentioned it and how many times; direct quotes for critical findings; observations grounded in concrete actions, not inference.
3. **Distinction Between Needs and Pain Points**: A NEED is aspirational (what the user needs to accomplish); a PAIN POINT is current-state friction. The same underlying issue may appear in both.
4. **Conflict Identification**: Conflicts are between roles, not individuals; each surfaces a genuine design tension (not a difference of opinion) with implications for the design, not just training.
5. **Security Concerns Prominence** (IL4+): the section is substantive; each concern maps to at least one compliance control; insights are elevated from the notes (not obvious statements).
6. **Research Gaps Completeness**: every gap has a "Recommended Resolution"; gap severity is justified.
7. **Finding Ranking**: needs ranked by operational impact and frequency; pain points by severity and frequency; rankings defensible from evidence.
