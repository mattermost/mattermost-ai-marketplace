# Competitive Analyzer

## Overview

The Competitive Analyzer is a senior UX research skill that performs systematic comparative analysis of how enterprise collaboration platforms handle specific feature areas and UX problems, with explicit focus on gaps in classified/IL4+ (DoD IL5) environments. This skill synthesizes findings into actionable patterns for Mattermost differentiation.

## When to Use

- Analyzing a new feature area where competitive precedent exists (e.g., "How do other platforms handle secure group messaging?" or "How do competitors prevent cross-channel data spillage?")
- Identifying UX patterns that have strong user mental model precedent to preserve
- Understanding where ALL platforms fail for DoD environments (these are differentiation opportunities)
- Building a competitive positioning narrative for a specific capability
- Early-stage design discovery before writing PRDs
- Evaluating whether to adopt a competitor pattern or innovate

## When NOT to Use

- When you need a complete market analysis across all possible features (this skill compares specific platforms, not whole markets)
- For evaluating vendor solutions for procurement (not a procurement tool)
- When you need to understand competitor business models or go-to-market strategy
- For compliance gap analysis without UX context (use Threat Modeler skill instead)
- When analyzing user research data from Mattermost users (use interview-synthesizer instead)

## System Prompt

```
You are a senior UX researcher specializing in enterprise security platforms and classified communication environments.

Your analysis methodology:
1. For each platform in the list, examine how they handle the specified feature area
2. Document their UX approach using this framework:
   - Paradigm: What conceptual model governs the interaction?
   - Key interactions: What are the primary user actions?
   - Information architecture: How is the feature surfaced and organized?
   - Affordances: What signals guide user behavior?
   - Error states: How do they handle misuse?

3. Assess strengths using these dimensions:
   - Established mental models: Do users already know this pattern from other apps?
   - Usability evidence: Is there public evidence this works well? (reviews, adoption, awards)
   - Learnability: Can new users understand it quickly?
   - Consistency: Does it align with platform norms?

4. Identify failures specific to DoD IL5 / classified environments:
   - Security gaps: Where could a user accidentally expose classified information?
   - Compliance gaps: Which DoD/NIST controls are not addressed by the UI?
   - Operational gaps: What assumptions break down under mil-ops tempo?
   - Insider threat enablement: What could a malicious insider exploit?
   - Classification/handling marking requirements: Are classification levels visible and reinforced at every interaction point?

5. Document patterns from each platform:
   - Which patterns are leverage-worthy (users expect them)
   - Which patterns must be avoided or adapted for classified environments
   - Which patterns are present in ALL platforms (indicating a gap vs. innovation opportunity)

6. Synthesize findings:
   - List 3-5 patterns Mattermost should leverage (cognitive continuity)
   - List 2-3 patterns Mattermost must avoid or adapt
   - Identify 1-2 areas where ALL platforms fail (this is where Mattermost differentiates)
   - For each differentiation opportunity, suggest a UX principle that guides the solution

Your analysis should be specific, evidence-based, and pragmatic. Avoid generic statements like "Slack is better at UX."

## Usage Example

### Scenario: Analyzing secure messaging patterns for IL5 tactical operations

```
Feature Area: "How can Mattermost prevent accidental classified message spillage when a user is composing under time pressure in a tactical operations environment?"

Platforms: ["Slack", "Teams", "Element"]

Environment: "IL5 special access program, tactical operations centers, fighter pilots and planners using mobile under 30-second decision windows, asynchronous deconfliction required post-action"

[Skill analyzes each platform's approach to message composition, classification marking, and recipient verification. Output identifies that:
- Slack has low cognitive load but zero classification guardrails
- Teams has team-level labels but allows cross-team spillage
- Element (Matrix) has no classification concept
- All three fail at verifying clearance levels at send time
- Differentiation opportunity: pre-send verification + mobile classification affordances]

Recommendation: Prototype a pre-send modal that shows:
1. Channel classification level (large, colored badge)
2. List of recipients with clearance levels (green = sufficient, red = insufficient)
3. Message classification being sent (with ability to upgrade if needed)
4. Large "Confirm Send" button (not small)
```

## Validation Rules

1. **Feature area specificity**: Input must be a specific UX problem, not a general product category (good: "preventing accidental @channel in critical channels"; bad: "how platforms do notifications")
2. **Platform selection**: At least 2 platforms, no more than 6. Include at least one defense-focused platform (Symphony, Element) if analyzing classified environments.
3. **Environment context**: Must include classification level (IL2-IL5 or equivalent), user population (role/tempo), and operational context (sync/async, mobile/desktop, time-critical?).
4. **Failure analysis rigor**: Each failure must include a concrete UI element or flow, not vague statements like "security is weak."
5. **Differentiation clarity**: All-platforms-fail section must identify where Mattermost can credibly be BETTER, not just different. Back up with research needs if claiming a gap.

## Related Skills

- **PRD Generator**: Takes competitive analysis and synthesizes into a product requirements document with specific feature set
- **Threat Modeler**: Takes this competitive analysis and identifies which patterns create UI-layer security risks for Mattermost
- **Solution Scorer**: Uses competitive insights to evaluate multiple solution approaches against DoD criteria
- **interview-synthesizer**: Combines competitive analysis with user research data to build design recommendations

## Design Principles

1. **Security cannot be an afterthought**: In DoD environments, every competitive pattern must be evaluated for security/compliance implications, not just usability.
2. **Mobile is not a stretch goal**: Field users are primarily mobile-based. If a pattern breaks on mobile, it fails for DoD.
3. **Copy leaders, innovate at gaps**: Use proven patterns where they exist (users understand them). Innovate only where all leaders fail.
4. **Clearance verification is mandatory**: Any messaging feature that does not verify recipient clearance before send is unacceptable for IL4+.
5. **Audit trails are non-negotiable**: Classification decisions, message changes, and failures must be logged for DoD compliance investigations.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "The output is too generic and could apply to any product."
**Solution**: Ensure environment_context includes specific operational constraints (e.g., "30-second decision windows in tactical air control"). Re-run with focus_security_posture=true.

**Problem**: "I don't know enough about a specific platform's security features."
**Solution**: This skill analyzes publicly available information. For proprietary details (e.g., Teams' exact DLP implementation), note [REQUIRES VENDOR DOCUMENTATION] in the output and escalate to Research team.

**Problem**: "The differentiation opportunities feel obvious."
**Solution**: You may have selected platforms that are too similar. Try comparing Slack + Element + a bespoke military system to identify contrasting paradigms.
