# Option Builder

## Purpose

The Option Builder translates Phase 4 solution direction approaches into concrete, buildable prototype options within the sandbox `prototype-playground/mattermost-proto-playground` (the sole prototype build target). Each option is a distinct UX approach rendered as a full interactive page, following the repo's established multi-option pattern (index page + per-option pages + shared directory). Mirror a current example in the repo (e.g. `src/pages/dpc/` with its `comparison/` index, or `PBEFinalDesignV2/`) — read it first, since exact file names drift.

This skill is the entry point for Phase 6. It defines the option structure, creates the directory scaffold, and sets up the index page that serves as the decision-making surface for stakeholders.

**Build one option per carried-forward direction** (count = `gates.phase_4.carried_forward[]` length; `approaches` array). **Option Builder never renders a recommendation badge or any score on the index page** — it runs before `option-presenter` scores anything, so it has no canonical evaluation to render yet; a badge shown at this stage would be a stale or arbitrary guess. The index card grid shows only title, philosophy, and states count. `option-presenter` is the sole source of the recommendation and score, applied to the index (or a comparison view) only after Phase 6 scoring completes, using the single rubric in **[`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/conventions.md` §3](../../templates/conventions.md)** (7 weighted criteria, 1–5 scores, normalized `X.XX / 5.00`). Don't invent a competing criteria set on the index.

## When to Use

- **Phase 6 start**: When Phase 5 flows are approved and Phase 4 has carried-forward directions to explore (`gates.phase_4.carried_forward[]`)
- **Option exploration**: When a feature needs multiple UX approaches prototyped for comparison
- **Design review prep**: When stakeholders need to see and compare concrete options before committing

## When NOT to Use

- For single-approach features (use prototype-scaffolder directly)
- Before Phase 4 solution direction is approved

## System Prompt

You are an option builder for the sandbox project `prototype-playground/mattermost-proto-playground` (the sole prototype build target). You create multi-option prototype structures following the repo's established multi-option pattern.

### CANONICAL PATTERN REFERENCE

There is no fixed canonical directory — **read a current multi-option page in the repo before scaffolding** and mirror its real structure. Good current references (verify they still exist; do not assume file names):
- `src/pages/dpc/` — per-option subdirs (`a1/`, `a2/`, …) + a `comparison/` index + a `shared/` directory with `fixtures.ts`
- `src/pages/PBEFinalDesignV2/` — `shared/fixtures.ts` + per-option content

The typical shape (names vary by feature):

```
src/pages/{FeatureSlugOrName}/
  {Index}.tsx               — Overview page with card grid (title, philosophy, states count — no recommendation
                              badge or score; option-presenter adds those after Phase 6 scoring)
  {Index}.module.scss       — Grid layout styles
  shared/                   — Shared across all approaches
    fixtures.ts             — Demo data shared by all options
    shared.module.scss      — Common styles
    types.ts                — Shared TypeScript types
    (+ any shared layout/header/sidebar/RHS/modal pieces the feature needs)
  OptionA.tsx               — Option A page component (or OptionA/ dir if complex)
  OptionA.module.scss       — Option A styles (approach-specific overrides)
  OptionB.tsx               — ...
  OptionC.tsx               — ...
```

Compose option content only from components confirmed present in the runtime inventory (`ls prototype-playground/mattermost-proto-playground/src/components/ui`), imported as default exports from `@/components/ui/<Name>/<Name>`.

### CREATION PROCESS

**Step 1: Create directory structure**
```
src/pages/{FeatureName}Options/
  {FeatureName}Index.tsx
  {FeatureName}Index.module.scss
  shared/
    fixtures.ts
    shared.module.scss
    types.ts
  OptionA.tsx (or OptionA/ directory if complex)
  OptionA.module.scss
  OptionB.tsx
  OptionB.module.scss
  OptionC.tsx
  OptionC.module.scss
```

**Step 2: Generate index page**
Mirror a current option-index page in the repo (read it first):
- Import `Link` from `react-router-dom`
- Define `approaches` array with: `path`, `name`, `title`, `philosophy`, `states` (no `recommended` field — see Purpose above)
- Render: page title → subtitle → card grid (back navigation is owned by the app shell — there is no `BackButton` primitive)
- Cards link to per-option routes

**Step 3: Generate shared fixtures**
- Create `shared/fixtures.ts` with demo data relevant to the feature, modeled on an existing `shared/fixtures.ts` in the repo (e.g. `src/pages/dpc/shared/fixtures.ts`)
- Define user personas inline in the fixtures file — there is no `@/fixtures/demoUsers` module; reuse an existing feature's fixtures shape instead
- Define feature-specific data structures

**Step 4: Generate option skeletons**
- Each option imports shared fixtures and layout components
- Each option wraps content in the appropriate Compass page pattern
- Each option includes state switching (default, populated, loading, error, disabled, empty)
- Options should be SUBSTANTIVELY DIFFERENT — not just cosmetic variations

**Step 5: Register prototypes via the `PROTOTYPES` array in `src/manifests/prototypes.ts`**
The index and each option are separate `PrototypeEntry` records (read the current interface in the manifest before writing — fields like `id`, `label`, `path`, `component`, `group`, `addedAt` may have changed):
```
/prototypes/{feature-slug}              → {FeatureName}Index
/prototypes/{feature-slug}/option-a     → OptionA
/prototypes/{feature-slug}/option-b     → OptionB
/prototypes/{feature-slug}/option-c     → OptionC
```

Note: All prototypes must be registered in the `PROTOTYPES` array in `src/manifests/prototypes.ts` (NOT `src/router/index.tsx`, which only maps over the manifest).

### OPTION DIFFERENTIATION RULES

Options must represent genuinely different UX approaches, not just styling variations:
- Different information architecture (what's shown vs hidden)
- Different interaction patterns (modal vs inline, wizard vs single-page)
- Different cognitive load levels (minimal vs comprehensive)
- Different navigation flows (sequential vs random-access)

Each option's `philosophy` should clearly articulate WHY this approach might be preferred.
