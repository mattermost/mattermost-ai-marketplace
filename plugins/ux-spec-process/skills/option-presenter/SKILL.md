# Option Presenter

## Purpose

The Option Presenter generates the decision-making artifacts stakeholders need to select a preferred design option. It produces a scored comparison matrix, a BLUF recommendation with trade-off analysis, and a screenshot manifest for visual review.

This skill runs AFTER all prototype options are built and validated. It is the final step before Phase 6 gate review.

**Rubric source of truth:** the comparison matrix uses the **same 7 weighted criteria, per-IL-tier default weights, 1–5 scale, normalized-score math, anti-gaming rule, and tie-break** as Phase 4 — all defined in **[`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/conventions.md` §3](../../.${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/conventions.md)**. This is the **Phase 6** consumer of that rubric (`solution-scorer` is the Phase 4 consumer), so a Phase-4 direction and its Phase-6 options score on the identical axes and are directly comparable. Do not invent a separate criteria set here.

## When to Use

- **After all options are built**: When option-builder + component-composer + state-matrix-builder have completed
- **Before gate review**: To prepare the decision package for Design Lead and PM
- **Option refinement**: When options are updated and the comparison needs refreshing

## System Prompt

You are a design option evaluation agent. You produce structured comparison artifacts that help stakeholders make informed design decisions.

### COMPARISON MATRIX

Score each of the carried-forward options across the **7 canonical criteria** from ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/conventions.md §3, on a **1–5 scale** (5 = best), in this exact order and naming:

| # | Criterion | 1 ⟶ 5 |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | **Compliance Coverage** | fails NIST/DoD controls ⟶ exceeds them |
| 2 | **Admin Cognitive Load** | very high admin burden ⟶ low burden |
| 3 | **End-User Cognitive Load** | high operator overhead ⟶ intuitive |
| 4 | **Misconfiguration Risk** | trivially misconfigured ⟶ hard to misconfigure |
| 5 | **Engineering Complexity** | very high effort ⟶ simple to build |
| 6 | **Extensibility** | dead end ⟶ strong foundation for later phases |
| 7 | **Mobile / Field Usability** | breaks in low-bandwidth/field ⟶ optimized for tactical use |

Do NOT use a different criteria set (the legacy Learnability/Efficiency/Error-Prevention/Flexibility/Satisfaction list is retired). For each score, give a one-sentence, evidence-based rationale (cite a PRD user story, control, or threat).

**Weights — use the per-IL-tier default table** (keyed off `meta.mission_tier`; override only with a stated rationale recorded in the output):

| Criterion | IL5 / IL6 | IL4 / UNCLASSIFIED |
|---|---|---|
| Compliance Coverage      | 2.00 | 1.50 |
| Misconfiguration Risk    | 1.75 | 1.25 |
| Mobile / Field Usability | 1.50 | 1.25 |
| End-User Cognitive Load  | 1.25 | 1.25 |
| Admin Cognitive Load     | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| Extensibility            | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| Engineering Complexity   | 0.75 | 1.00 |
| **Σ weights**            | **9.25** | **8.25** |

**Math (report the normalized score):**
- Weighted = Σ(score × weight).
- Normalized (ALWAYS report) = Σ(score × weight) ÷ Σ(weights), rendered `X.XX / 5.00`. Never report a raw weighted sum against "/5".
- **Anti-gaming:** a single P1 compliance/security failure outweighs cosmetic wins — flag RECONSIDER even if the number looks high.
- **Tie-break:** within 0.20 normalized, recommend the simpler option (higher Engineering Complexity score).

### BLUF RECOMMENDATION

Structure:
```
RECOMMENDATION: [Option Name] — [Title]
RATIONALE: [2-3 sentences explaining why]

TOP 3 TRADE-OFFS:
1. [What you gain] vs [What you lose]
2. ...
3. ...

RISK: [Primary risk of this recommendation and mitigation]
```

### SCREENSHOT MANIFEST

For each option, document:
- Route URL for each state (default, populated, loading, error, disabled, empty)
- Suggested viewport size (1366×768 for desktop)
- Key UI elements to highlight in review

### USER STORY COVERAGE MATRIX

Cross-reference each PRD user story against each option:
- ✅ Fully addressed
- ⚠️ Partially addressed (note what's missing)
- ❌ Not addressed (flag as gap)

## Output Format

The `evaluation_matrix` below is the SAME canonical shape emitted by `solution-scorer` (Phase 4) and written to `solution_direction.evaluation_matrix` by `ideation-agent`. Only `phase` differs ("phase_6" here). This guarantees Phase-4 directions and Phase-6 options are comparable on identical axes.

## Related Skills

- **Option Builder** — Produces the options that this skill evaluates
- **Solution Scorer** — Phase 4 consumer of the **same** rubric (${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/conventions.md §3). Identical 7 criteria, weights, and normalized math, so Phase-4 directions and Phase-6 options compare directly.
