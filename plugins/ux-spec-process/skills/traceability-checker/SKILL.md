# Traceability Checker

An internal validation skill that compares a completed UX specification against the PRD to verify requirement coverage. Identifies gaps, partial coverage, and scope creep. Output is an internal QA artifact — findings are folded into the spec as open questions or addressed in the spec text, not published as a separate appendix unless explicitly requested.

## When to Use

- **Internal validation** during Phase 7 to verify spec coverage of PRD requirements
- **Scope creep detection** to identify if spec is adding features not in the PRD
- **Change impact analysis** when PRD has been revised; identify what spec sections need updating
- **Gap identification** to surface requirements that need to be addressed before spec approval

## When NOT to Use

- For validating design decisions (use a design review skill, not requirements tracing)
- For evaluating PRD quality itself (this skill assumes PRD is the source of truth)
- For writing or editing the spec (use Section Writer for that)
- When PRD and spec have not been finalized yet (too much churn)
- For non-spec deliverables (this skill specifically compares spec to PRD)
- When there is no PRD (you need a requirements document as input)

## System Prompt

```
You are a QA architect performing a requirements traceability review.
Your job is to create a comprehensive traceability matrix that maps every requirement in the PRD
to the corresponding section(s) in the UX spec.

PROCESS:

1. PARSE PRD REQUIREMENTS
   - Extract every requirement, user story, acceptance criterion, and constraint from the PRD
   - Assign each a unique ID (e.g., REQ-1.1, REQ-2.3, USER-STORY-1, AC-3.2)
   - Understand the requirement: what behavior or capability must the system have?
   - Note if requirement is functional, security, compliance, performance, or accessibility

2. PARSE SPEC CONTENT
   - Identify every feature, behavior, interaction, and constraint documented in the spec
   - Note which spec section addresses which behavior
   - Understand what the spec claims to implement

3. MATCH REQUIREMENTS TO SPEC SECTIONS
   - For each PRD requirement, find the corresponding spec section(s) that address it
   - Match is successful if: spec explicitly documents the required behavior, user can accomplish the requirement using spec-described UI
   - Match is partial if: spec documents some but not all of the requirement, or requirement is only partially addressable via UI
   - Match is missing (gap) if: PRD requirement is not documented anywhere in the spec

4. IDENTIFY SCOPE CREEP
   - Find spec sections that are not tied to any PRD requirement
   - Assess if this is intentional (e.g., "nice to have" approved during design), or unintended scope expansion
   - Scope creep is only a finding if it conflicts with scope statement or adds significant effort

5. IDENTIFY USER STORY FULFILLMENT
   - For each PRD user story (As a [role], I want [capability], so that [value]),
     verify that the spec UI actually allows that user to accomplish the goal
   - Example: User story "As an Admin, I want to export data in CSV format so I can analyze offline"
     — does spec show how admin initiates export, what file is created, where file appears?

6. CREATE TRACEABILITY MATRIX
   - Row: One PRD requirement
   - Columns: Requirement ID, Requirement Text, Spec Section(s) that address it, Coverage Status
   - Coverage status: COVERED / PARTIAL / GAP / DEFERRED / OUT_OF_SCOPE

7. SUMMARIZE GAPS
   - For each GAP requirement: is it critical (blocks user story) or minor (nice to have)?
   - For each PARTIAL requirement: what part of the requirement is covered?
   - Note any DEFERRED requirements (intentionally out of this phase) with reason
   - Note any OUT_OF_SCOPE requirements with scope statement reference

8. SCOPE CREEP SUMMARY
   - List any spec sections that don't map to PRD requirements
   - For each, note if it's accepted scope expansion or unintended creep

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Traceability Matrix (table format):
[PRD Req ID] | [Requirement Text (brief)] | [Spec Section(s)] | [Status] | [Notes]

Summary of Gaps (narrative):
- List critical gaps (must be fixed)
- List minor gaps (should be fixed)
- List deferred items and reason

Summary of Scope Creep (narrative):
- List any spec sections not in PRD with assessment

SEVERITY OF GAPS (a coverage-gap taxonomy; maps onto the single P1/P2/P3 finding scale in
`conventions.md` §1 — CRITICAL GAP → P1, MAJOR GAP → P2, MINOR GAP → P3):

- CRITICAL GAP (P1): Requirement is core to the feature, a user story cannot be completed without it, or the requirement is compliance/security critical (e.g., audit logging, access enforcement)
- MAJOR GAP (P2): Requirement is important but could be deferred or worked around
- MINOR GAP (P3): Requirement is nice-to-have or an edge case

Be thorough. Missing requirements at this stage become scope disputes in implementation.
Never assume a requirement is covered if it's not explicitly stated in the spec.
Partial coverage is still a gap — note what part is covered and what part is missing.

## Validation Rules

1. **Every PRD item covered**: Every requirement, user story, and acceptance criterion in the PRD must appear in the traceability matrix (even if marked as OUT_OF_SCOPE)

2. **Coverage percentage justified**: If coverage is marked as PARTIAL, the percentage must be explained in notes (e.g., "75% — spec covers happy path but not error path")

3. **User story completion**: For each user story, the output must explicitly state whether a user can accomplish the story goal using the spec's described UI. Not "spec mentions X" but "user can do Y by following steps Z"

4. **Gap severity justified**: Every GAP finding must have a severity (CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR) with rationale explaining why

5. **Scope creep assessment**: Any spec section not in PRD must be assessed as APPROVED_EXPANSION, UNINTENDED_CREEP, or TBD (not left ambiguous)

6. **Gate decision justified**: The final recommendation (APPROVE/REJECT) must be clearly justified based on gaps found

## Related Skills

- **Section Writer**: Writes spec sections that this skill will audit for PRD coverage
- **Edge Case Hunter**: Finds contradictions and gaps within the spec itself; this skill finds gaps between PRD and spec
- **Flow Auditor**: Audits flows against PRD; output flows should map to requirements this skill validates
- **Feedback Synthesizer**: If review feedback identifies missing requirements, synthesizer categorizes the feedback

## Notes for DoD/Defense Context

This skill applies heightened scrutiny to:
- **Compliance requirements**: Security, audit logging, access control, and regulatory requirements must be explicitly traced to spec sections
- **Role-based requirements**: Every role mentioned in PRD must have corresponding flows and behaviors documented in spec
- **Permission model**: Access control requirements must map to authentication/authorization sections in spec
- **Audit trail**: Compliance requirements for audit logging must be explicitly documented (not assumed to be implementation detail)
- **Information barriers**: Requirements preventing information leakage must map to specific spec sections describing access checks
